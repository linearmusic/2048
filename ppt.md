**Slide 2: Introduction - The Moho Mystery**

*   **Headline:** Why Study the Moho?
*   **What is the Moho?**
    *   Mohorovičić discontinuity: The fundamental boundary between Earth's crust and mantle.
    *   Crucial for understanding tectonics, isostasy, resource formation, Earth evolution.
*   **How do we "see" it?**
    *   **Indirect Methods are Key:** Seismology (refraction, reflection, receiver functions) & Gravimetry.
    *   **Seismology:** Good resolution where data exists, but often sparse coverage (especially in remote areas/oceans).
    *   **Gravimetry:** Potential for large-scale, relatively uniform coverage (especially with satellites like GOCE, GRACE), but interpretation is challenging.
*   **Visual:** A simple diagram showing Earth layers (Crust, Moho, Mantle). Maybe small icons representing seismic waves and a satellite.

**Slide 3: The Challenge: Gravity Inversion for Moho Depth**

*   **Headline:** Turning Gravity into Structure - The Inverse Problem
*   **The Goal:** Estimate Moho depth variations (relief) from measurements of Earth's gravity field.
*   **Why is it hard?**
    *   **Non-uniqueness:** Different subsurface structures can produce the same gravity signal.
    *   **Nonlinearity:** The relationship between Moho depth and gravity is *not* a simple linear one. Deeper variations have less effect.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Realistic modeling involves huge numbers of parameters and calculations.
    *   **Earth's Curvature:** For regional/global studies, a flat-Earth approximation is inaccurate. Spherical geometry is needed.
    *   **Data Isolation:** The gravity signal from the Moho is mixed with signals from topography, oceans, sediments, deeper mantle variations.
*   **Visual:** Maybe a diagram showing a gravity anomaly profile over a varying Moho, hinting at the inverse nature of the problem.

**Slide 4: Existing Approaches & Their Limitations**

*   **Headline:** Building on Previous Work
*   **Briefly Mention Key Methods:**
    *   **Parker-Oldenburg (FFT-based):** Efficient on flat Earth, assumes constant density contrast, struggles with spherical geometry.
    *   **Spherical Harmonics:** Intrinsically spherical, good for global scale, but can be complex and less suited for sharp, local features.
    *   **Prism/Voxel Methods (Space Domain):** Can handle complex shapes, but often use rectangular prisms (planar) or are computationally very heavy if using tesseroids (spherical prisms) with standard inversion.
    *   **Bott's Method (Iterative):** Very efficient (avoids large matrices!), but originally unstable and hard to regularize formally.
*   **Key Limitations Addressed by this Paper:**
    *   Need for efficiency *with* spherical geometry.
    *   Need for a stable, regularized inversion *that is also fast*.
    *   Need a robust way to estimate key unknown parameters (hyperparameters).
*   **Visual:** Simple icons representing FFT, sphere, prisms.

**Slide 5: The Proposed Solution - Methodology Overview**

*   **Headline:** A Smart Combination for Fast, Spherical Inversion
*   **Core Idea:** Combine the strengths of different techniques:
    1.  **Bott's Method Efficiency:** Leverage its iterative nature that avoids building and solving large, dense linear systems.
    2.  **Tikhonov Regularization:** Introduce stability and control smoothness (avoids noise amplification and unrealistic oscillations). This overcomes Bott's instability.
    3.  **Tesseroids (Spherical Prisms):** Accurately model geometry and calculate gravity effects in spherical coordinates.
    4.  **Robust Hyperparameter Estimation:** Use data-driven methods (cross-validation) to find optimal control parameters.
*   **Visual:** A flow chart or diagram showing: [Gravity Data] -> [Preprocessing] -> [Bott-inspired Regularized Inversion w/ Tesseroids] -> [Moho Model]. Highlight the key components (Bott, Regularization, Tesseroids).

**Slide 6: Methodology - Step 1: Isolating the Moho Signal**

*   **Headline:** Cleaning the Data
*   **Goal:** Remove known gravity effects to isolate the signal from the anomalous Moho relief.
*   **Steps (Reference Figure 1):**
    1.  **Observed Gravity (g(P))**: What the satellite measures.
    2.  **Remove Normal Gravity (γ(P))**: Subtract effect of a reference ellipsoid -> **Gravity Disturbance (δ(P))**.
    3.  **Remove Topography/Bathymetry (g_topo(P))**: Calculate and subtract effect of mountains and oceans using tesseroids -> **Bouguer Disturbance (δ_bg(P))**.
    4.  **Remove Sedimentary Basins**: Calculate and subtract effect of known low-density sediments using tesseroid models (e.g., from CRUST1.0).
*   **Result:** A gravity anomaly map primarily reflecting density variations at/below the crust - targeting the Moho.
*   **Visual:** Show panels (a), (c), (d), (e) from Figure 1, explaining the transformation at each step. Use Figure 8 (a-d, h) for the real data example later.

---

**Slide 7: Methodology - Step 2: Parametrization & Forward Model**

*   **Headline:** Representing the Moho
*   **Parametrization:**
    *   Discretize the anomalous Moho into a grid of **tesseroids** (spherical prisms) (Reference Figure 1f, Figure 2).
    *   Each tesseroid `k` has an unknown depth `z_k`. This depth is relative to a **reference Moho depth (z_ref)**.
    *   The collection of all depths `z_k` forms the parameter vector **p**.
    *   A **density contrast (Δρ)** between the crust and mantle across the Moho is assumed.
*   **Forward Problem:**
    *   Given a set of parameters **p** (Moho depths), calculate the predicted gravity effect **d(p)** at each observation point.
    *   This involves summing the gravitational attraction of all tesseroids.
    *   Requires accurate numerical integration (Gauss-Legendre Quadrature) and adaptive discretization for points close to tesseroids (Uieda et al., 2016). `d = f(p)`
*   **Visual:** Show Figure 2 (tesseroid geometry) and Figure 1f (discretized Moho).

**Slide 8: Methodology - Step 3: The Inverse Problem & Regularization**

*   **Headline:** Finding the Best Fit - Stably
*   **Least-Squares Goal:** Find the Moho depths **p** that minimize the difference between observed data **d⁰** and predicted data **d(p)**: Minimize ||**d⁰** - **d(p)**||².
*   **Challenge:** This is ill-posed (non-unique, sensitive to noise).
*   **Solution: Tikhonov Regularization**
    *   Add a penalty term that favors "simpler" or "smoother" models.
    *   Minimize: ||**d⁰** - **d(p)**||² + μ ||**R p**||²
        *   μ (mu): Regularization parameter (hyperparameter) - controls the trade-off between data fit and smoothness.
        *   **R**: A matrix that measures the roughness (e.g., differences between adjacent Moho depths).
*   **Optimization:** Use an iterative method (like Gauss-Newton) to find the minimum of this combined function. Standard Gauss-Newton requires calculating the Jacobian (sensitivity matrix **A**) and solving a large linear system at each step (Eq. 13) - potentially slow!
*   **Visual:** Show the Tikhonov objective function. Maybe a graph showing how regularization smooths a noisy solution.

---

**Slide 9: Methodology - Step 4: The Innovation - Fast & Regularized**

*   **Headline:** Combining Bott's Speed with Regularized Stability
*   **Bott's Original Method (Eq. 14):**
    *   Iteratively updates depths: Δp ≈ (d⁰ - d(p)) / (2πGΔρ)
    *   Insight (Silva et al., 2014): This implicitly approximates the Jacobian **A** as a diagonal matrix (Eq. 15): **A** ≈ (2πGΔρ) **I**. *This avoids calculating and storing the huge, dense Jacobian.*
*   **This Paper's Contribution (Eq. 13 implemented efficiently):**
    *   Use Bott's diagonal approximation for **A** *within* the standard Tikhonov-regularized Gauss-Newton framework.
    *   The system to solve becomes: [(2πGΔρ)² **I** + μ **RᵀR**] Δp = (2πGΔρ) [**d⁰** - **d(p)**] - μ **RᵀR p** (Simplified from Eq 13 using Eq 15)
    *   Crucially, the matrix [(2πGΔρ)² **I** + μ **RᵀR**] is **SPARSE** (because **I** is diagonal and **R** involves only adjacent cells).
    *   **Benefit:** Can be solved *very efficiently* using sparse linear algebra routines.
*   **Summary:** Get the stability of regularization and spherical accuracy of tesseroids, *plus* near the computational speed of Bott's method!
*   **Visual:** Contrast Eq. 13 (standard, dense) with the sparse system derived here. Highlight the term (2πGΔρ)**I**. Emphasize "Sparse = Fast".

**Slide 10: Methodology - Step 5: Estimating the Hyperparameters**

*   **Headline:** Tuning the Inversion - Letting the Data Decide
*   **Problem:** The inversion result depends on:
    *   μ (Regularization parameter)
    *   Δρ (Density contrast)
    *   z_ref (Reference Moho depth)
*   **Solution: Data-Driven Estimation**
    *   **Step 1: Estimate μ using Hold-Out Cross-Validation:**
        *   Split gravity data: Training set (used for inversion) & Testing set (used for validation) (Reference Figure 3).
        *   Invert the *training* data for a range of μ values (keeping Δρ, z_ref fixed initially).
        *   Calculate predicted data on the *testing* locations for each resulting model.
        *   Choose the μ that gives the minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the *testing* set (best predictive power). (Reference Figure 5e, 7a, 10a).
    *   **Step 2: Estimate Δρ and z_ref using Independent Data (Seismic Moho depths):**
        *   Use the optimal μ found above.
        *   Perform inversions for a grid of plausible (Δρ, z_ref) combinations.
        *   For each resulting Moho model, interpolate the depths at locations where seismic Moho estimates (z⁰) exist.
        *   Choose the (Δρ, z_ref) pair that minimizes the MSE between the inverted depths (zᵐ) and the known seismic depths (z⁰). (Reference Figure 7b, 10b).
*   **Visual:** Show Figure 3 (data splitting). Show example cross-validation curve (like Fig 10a) and validation grid search (like Fig 10b).

**Slide 11: Validation - Synthetic Test 1: Simple Model**

*   **Headline:** Does it Work? Testing on a Known Structure
*   **Purpose:** Verify the method and the μ estimation on a simple, controlled case.
*   **Setup (Figure 4):**
    *   Simulated continental-to-oceanic Moho transition (known true depths).
    *   Known Δρ, z_ref.
    *   Generate synthetic gravity data, add realistic noise.
*   **Results (Figure 5):**
    *   Cross-validation successfully identifies an optimal μ (Fig 5e).
    *   Inverted Moho (Fig 5a) is smooth and recovers the main trend well.
    *   Residuals (difference between true and estimated Moho, Fig 5b; difference between observed and predicted gravity, Fig 5c, 5d) are small and well-behaved.
    *   **Computational Time (Table 1):** Confirms efficiency - >99% of time spent on forward modeling (calculating tesseroid gravity), <0.1% on solving the sparse linear system.
*   **Conclusion:** The method is efficient, stable (due to regularization), and μ estimation works.

**Slide 12: Validation - Synthetic Test 2: Realistic Model (CRUST1.0)**

*   **Headline:** Testing on a More Complex, Realistic Scenario
*   **Purpose:** Test the full hyperparameter estimation (μ, Δρ, z_ref) on a complex model derived from South America's CRUST1.0.
*   **Setup (Figure 6):**
    *   Realistic Moho geometry (Fig 6a).
    *   Generate synthetic gravity (Fig 6b) and "seismic" Moho point data (Fig 6c). Add noise.
*   **Results (Figure 7):**
    *   Cross-validation finds optimal μ (Fig 7a).
    *   Validation grid search finds optimal Δρ and z_ref, matching the true values (Fig 7b).
    *   Recovered Moho (Fig 7c) captures large-scale features.
    *   Larger residuals (Fig 7d, g, h) occur where the true Moho has sharp changes (e.g., Andes), indicating limitations of smoothness regularization for very sharp features.
*   **Conclusion:** The full hyperparameter estimation pipeline works. The method recovers realistic structures but smooths sharp gradients.

    *   Seismic Moho Depths: Compiled dataset from Assumpção et al. (2013) (Figure 9b) - used for validation (Δρ, z_ref estimation).
*   **Inversion Process:**
    *   Run cross-validation to find optimal μ (Figure 10a). Value suggests very little regularization needed for this dataset.
    *   Run validation grid search using seismic data to find optimal Δρ and z_ref (Figure 10b). Finds Δρ ≈ 400 kg/m³, z_ref ≈ 35 km.
*   **Visual:** Show the final input gravity map (Fig 9a) and the seismic data points (Fig 9b). Show the hyperparameter estimation results (Fig 10).

**Slide 14: Results - The South American Moho Model**

*   **Headline:** A New View of South America's Foundation
*   **The Final Model (Figure 11):**
    *   Show the color map of the estimated Moho depth.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Deep Moho under the Andes (> 60-70 km).
        *   Shallow Moho in oceanic regions (10-20 km).
        *   Relatively deep Moho under ancient shield areas (Brazilian, Guyana > 35-40 km).
        *   Shallower Moho (< 35 km) in major basins (Amazonas, Paraná, Chaco) and Andean foreland.
    *   **Comparison:** Generally consistent with previous large-scale models (e.g., GMSA12) but provides a high-resolution view based on this specific method.
*   **Visual:** Feature Figure 11 prominently. Use arrows or annotations to point out key geographic/geologic regions mentioned.

**Slide 15: Discussion - Model Fit & Interpretation**

*   **Headline:** How Well Does it Fit? What Does it Mean?
*   **Gravity Residuals (Figure 12a):**
    *   Difference between observed and predicted gravity.
    *   Smallest residuals in oceanic areas, Patagonia, central/eastern Brazil (good fit).
    *   Largest residuals along the Andes (sharp gradients, unmodeled Nazca plate effect?) and basin margins.
*   **Seismic Comparison (Figure 12b):**
    *   Difference between model Moho and seismic Moho estimates.
    *   Good agreement in many areas (oceans, Patagonia, parts of Brazil).
    *   **Significant Discrepancies:**
        *   Andes: Model likely smooths the very deep roots; subducting plate effect not included.
        *   Amazonas/Paraná/Solimões Basins: Model predicts *shallower* Moho than seismology suggests. Implies an unmodeled *mass excess* in the real Earth (e.g., high-density lower crustal intrusions?).
        *   Guyana Shield/Borborema Province: Differences suggest unaccounted crustal/mantle density variations or sediment model inaccuracies.
*   **Visual:** Show Figure 12 panels, highlighting areas of good fit and large discrepancies.
