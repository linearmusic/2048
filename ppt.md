**Slide 2: Introduction - The Moho Mystery**

*   **Headline:** Why Study the Moho?
*   **What is the Moho?**
    *   Mohorovičić discontinuity: The fundamental boundary between Earth's crust and mantle.
    *   Crucial for understanding tectonics, isostasy, resource formation, Earth evolution.
*   **How do we "see" it?**
    *   **Indirect Methods are Key:** Seismology (refraction, reflection, receiver functions) & Gravimetry.
    *   **Seismology:** Good resolution where data exists, but often sparse coverage (especially in remote areas/oceans).
    *   **Gravimetry:** Potential for large-scale, relatively uniform coverage (especially with satellites like GOCE, GRACE), but interpretation is challenging.
*   **Visual:** A simple diagram showing Earth layers (Crust, Moho, Mantle). Maybe small icons representing seismic waves and a satellite.

**Slide 3: The Challenge: Gravity Inversion for Moho Depth**

*   **Headline:** Turning Gravity into Structure - The Inverse Problem
*   **The Goal:** Estimate Moho depth variations (relief) from measurements of Earth's gravity field.
*   **Why is it hard?**
    *   **Non-uniqueness:** Different subsurface structures can produce the same gravity signal.
    *   **Nonlinearity:** The relationship between Moho depth and gravity is *not* a simple linear one. Deeper variations have less effect.
    *   **Computational Cost:** Realistic modeling involves huge numbers of parameters and calculations.
    *   **Earth's Curvature:** For regional/global studies, a flat-Earth approximation is inaccurate. Spherical geometry is needed.
    *   **Data Isolation:** The gravity signal from the Moho is mixed with signals from topography, oceans, sediments, deeper mantle variations.
*   **Visual:** Maybe a diagram showing a gravity anomaly profile over a varying Moho, hinting at the inverse nature of the problem.

**Slide 4: Existing Approaches & Their Limitations**

*   **Headline:** Building on Previous Work
*   **Briefly Mention Key Methods:**
    *   **Parker-Oldenburg (FFT-based):** Efficient on flat Earth, assumes constant density contrast, struggles with spherical geometry.
    *   **Spherical Harmonics:** Intrinsically spherical, good for global scale, but can be complex and less suited for sharp, local features.
    *   **Prism/Voxel Methods (Space Domain):** Can handle complex shapes, but often use rectangular prisms (planar) or are computationally very heavy if using tesseroids (spherical prisms) with standard inversion.
    *   **Bott's Method (Iterative):** Very efficient (avoids large matrices!), but originally unstable and hard to regularize formally.
*   **Key Limitations Addressed by this Paper:**
    *   Need for efficiency *with* spherical geometry.
    *   Need for a stable, regularized inversion *that is also fast*.
    *   Need a robust way to estimate key unknown parameters (hyperparameters).
*   **Visual:** Simple icons representing FFT, sphere, prisms.

**Slide 5: The Proposed Solution - Methodology Overview**

*   **Headline:** A Smart Combination for Fast, Spherical Inversion
*   **Core Idea:** Combine the strengths of different techniques:
    1.  **Bott's Method Efficiency:** Leverage its iterative nature that avoids building and solving large, dense linear systems.
    2.  **Tikhonov Regularization:** Introduce stability and control smoothness (avoids noise amplification and unrealistic oscillations). This overcomes Bott's instability.
    3.  **Tesseroids (Spherical Prisms):** Accurately model geometry and calculate gravity effects in spherical coordinates.
    4.  **Robust Hyperparameter Estimation:** Use data-driven methods (cross-validation) to find optimal control parameters.
*   **Visual:** A flow chart or diagram showing: [Gravity Data] -> [Preprocessing] -> [Bott-inspired Regularized Inversion w/ Tesseroids] -> [Moho Model]. Highlight the key components (Bott, Regularization, Tesseroids).

**Slide 6: Methodology - Step 1: Isolating the Moho Signal**

*   **Headline:** Cleaning the Data
*   **Goal:** Remove known gravity effects to isolate the signal from the anomalous Moho relief.
*   **Steps (Reference Figure 1):**
    1.  **Observed Gravity (g(P))**: What the satellite measures.
    2.  **Remove Normal Gravity (γ(P))**: Subtract effect of a reference ellipsoid -> **Gravity Disturbance (δ(P))**.
    3.  **Remove Topography/Bathymetry (g_topo(P))**: Calculate and subtract effect of mountains and oceans using tesseroids -> **Bouguer Disturbance (δ_bg(P))**.
    4.  **Remove Sedimentary Basins**: Calculate and subtract effect of known low-density sediments using tesseroid models (e.g., from CRUST1.0).
*   **Result:** A gravity anomaly map primarily reflecting density variations at/below the crust - targeting the Moho.
*   **Visual:** Show panels (a), (c), (d), (e) from Figure 1, explaining the transformation at each step. Use Figure 8 (a-d, h) for the real data example later.

**Slide 7: Methodology - Step 2: Parametrization & Forward Model**

*   **Headline:** Representing the Moho
*   **Parametrization:**
    *   Discretize the anomalous Moho into a grid of **tesseroids** (spherical prisms) (Reference Figure 1f, Figure 2).
    *   Each tesseroid `k` has an unknown depth `z_k`. This depth is relative to a **reference Moho depth (z_ref)**.
    *   The collection of all depths `z_k` forms the parameter vector **p**.
    *   A **density contrast (Δρ)** between the crust and mantle across the Moho is assumed.
*   **Forward Problem:**
    *   Given a set of parameters **p** (Moho depths), calculate the predicted gravity effect **d(p)** at each observation point.
    *   This involves summing the gravitational attraction of all tesseroids.
    *   Requires accurate numerical integration (Gauss-Legendre Quadrature) and adaptive discretization for points close to tesseroids (Uieda et al., 2016). `d = f(p)`
*   **Visual:** Show Figure 2 (tesseroid geometry) and Figure 1f (discretized Moho).

**Slide 8: Methodology - Step 3: The Inverse Problem & Regularization**

*   **Headline:** Finding the Best Fit - Stably
*   **Least-Squares Goal:** Find the Moho depths **p** that minimize the difference between observed data **d⁰** and predicted data **d(p)**: Minimize ||**d⁰** - **d(p)**||².
*   **Challenge:** This is ill-posed (non-unique, sensitive to noise).
*   **Solution: Tikhonov Regularization**
    *   Add a penalty term that favors "simpler" or "smoother" models.
    *   Minimize: ||**d⁰** - **d(p)**||² + μ ||**R p**||²
        *   μ (mu): Regularization parameter (hyperparameter) - controls the trade-off between data fit and smoothness.
        *   **R**: A matrix that measures the roughness (e.g., differences between adjacent Moho depths).
*   **Optimization:** Use an iterative method (like Gauss-Newton) to find the minimum of this combined function. Standard Gauss-Newton requires calculating the Jacobian (sensitivity matrix **A**) and solving a large linear system at each step (Eq. 13) - potentially slow!
*   **Visual:** Show the Tikhonov objective function. Maybe a graph showing how regularization smooths a noisy solution.

---

**Slide 9: Methodology - Step 4: The Innovation - Fast & Regularized**

*   **Headline:** Combining Bott's Speed with Regularized Stability
*   **Bott's Original Method (Eq. 14):**
    *   Iteratively updates depths: Δp ≈ (d⁰ - d(p)) / (2πGΔρ)
    *   Insight (Silva et al., 2014): This implicitly approximates the Jacobian **A** as a diagonal matrix (Eq. 15): **A** ≈ (2πGΔρ) **I**. *This avoids calculating and storing the huge, dense Jacobian.*
*   **This Paper's Contribution (Eq. 13 implemented efficiently):**
    *   Use Bott's diagonal approximation for **A** *within* the standard Tikhonov-regularized Gauss-Newton framework.
    *   The system to solve becomes: [(2πGΔρ)² **I** + μ **RᵀR**] Δp = (2πGΔρ) [**d⁰** - **d(p)**] - μ **RᵀR p** (Simplified from Eq 13 using Eq 15)
    *   Crucially, the matrix [(2πGΔρ)² **I** + μ **RᵀR**] is **SPARSE** (because **I** is diagonal and **R** involves only adjacent cells).
    *   **Benefit:** Can be solved *very efficiently* using sparse linear algebra routines.
*   **Summary:** Get the stability of regularization and spherical accuracy of tesseroids, *plus* near the computational speed of Bott's method!
*   **Visual:** Contrast Eq. 13 (standard, dense) with the sparse system derived here. Highlight the term (2πGΔρ)**I**. Emphasize "Sparse = Fast".

**Slide 10: Methodology - Step 5: Estimating the Hyperparameters**

*   **Headline:** Tuning the Inversion - Letting the Data Decide
*   **Problem:** The inversion result depends on:
    *   μ (Regularization parameter)
    *   Δρ (Density contrast)
    *   z_ref (Reference Moho depth)
*   **Solution: Data-Driven Estimation**
    *   **Step 1: Estimate μ using Hold-Out Cross-Validation:**
        *   Split gravity data: Training set (used for inversion) & Testing set (used for validation) (Reference Figure 3).
        *   Invert the *training* data for a range of μ values (keeping Δρ, z_ref fixed initially).
        *   Calculate predicted data on the *testing* locations for each resulting model.
        *   Choose the μ that gives the minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the *testing* set (best predictive power). (Reference Figure 5e, 7a, 10a).
    *   **Step 2: Estimate Δρ and z_ref using Independent Data (Seismic Moho depths):**
        *   Use the optimal μ found above.
        *   Perform inversions for a grid of plausible (Δρ, z_ref) combinations.
        *   For each resulting Moho model, interpolate the depths at locations where seismic Moho estimates (z⁰) exist.
        *   Choose the (Δρ, z_ref) pair that minimizes the MSE between the inverted depths (zᵐ) and the known seismic depths (z⁰). (Reference Figure 7b, 10b).
*   **Visual:** Show Figure 3 (data splitting). Show example cross-validation curve (like Fig 10a) and validation grid search (like Fig 10b).

**Slide 1: Validation - Method Proven on Synthetic Data**

*   **Headline:** Method Validation: Efficient, Stable & Accurate
*   **Purpose:** Tested the inversion's efficiency, stability (regularization), and hyperparameter estimation (μ, Δρ, z_ref) using known synthetic models.
*   **Tests Conducted:**
    *   **Simple Model (Fig 4, 5):** Smooth continental-oceanic transition.
    *   **Realistic Model (CRUST1.0 South America - Fig 6, 7):** Complex known geometry.
*   **Key Validation Findings:**
    *   **Recovers Structure:** Inverted Moho matches known synthetic structures well (smoothly). (See Fig 5a, 7c)
    *   **Hyperparameter Estimation Works:**
        *   Cross-validation reliably finds optimal regularization μ (Fig 5e, 7a).
        *   Validation with synthetic seismic points correctly identifies true Δρ & z_ref (Fig 7b).
    *   **Highly Efficient:** >99% time spent on necessary forward modeling (tesseroids), <0.1% on solving the sparse system (Table 1).
    *   **Known Limitation:** Smoothness regularization struggles to perfectly replicate very sharp Moho changes (e.g., synthetic Andes - Fig 7d residuals).
*   **Conclusion:** The method and hyperparameter pipeline are robust and computationally feasible for large-scale problems.

**Slide 2: Application - Mapping the South American Moho**

*   **Headline:** Applying the Validated Method to Real Data
*   **Input Data:**
    *   **Gravity:** GOCO5S satellite gravity, processed to isolate Moho signal (corrected for topography, bathymetry, sediments - Fig 9a).
    *   **Seismic Control:** Moho depth estimates at specific points (Assumpção et al., 2013) used for validation only (Fig 9b).
*   **Hyperparameter Estimation (Real Data):**
    *   Optimal regularization μ found via cross-validation (Fig 10a).
    *   Optimal Density Contrast (Δρ ≈ 400 kg/m³) & Reference Depth (z_ref ≈ 35 km) found by matching model to seismic points (Fig 10b).
*   **The Result: South American Moho Depth Model**
    *   **(Show Figure 11 prominently)**
    *   **Major Features Visible:** Deep Andean roots (>60km), shallow oceanic Moho (~10-20km), deep shields (Brazilian, Guyana), shallower basins (Amazonas, Paraná, Chaco). Consistent with known large-scale geology.

**(Visuals: Fig 9a (Input Gravity), Fig 10b (Validation Grid), Fig 11 (The Final Map))**

**Slide 3: Discussion - Model Fit & Geological Interpretation**

*   **Headline:** How Well Does the Model Fit? What Does it Tell Us?
*   **Model Performance:**
    *   **Gravity Fit (Fig 12a):** Generally good fit (low residuals) in stable regions (oceans, E. Brazil). Larger misfits along Andes (sharp gradients, unmodeled subducting plate effects).
    *   **Seismic Fit (Fig 12b):** Good agreement in many areas, but significant discrepancies highlight geology/limitations:
        *   **Andes:** Model likely smooths the sharpest features; missing plate effects.
        *   **Basins (Amazon, Paraná etc.):** Model predicts *shallower* Moho than seismic indicates -> Suggests unmodeled **mass excess** in the crust/mantle (e.g., intrusions?) not accounted for in corrections.
        *   **Shields/Provinces:** Misfits may point to inaccuracies in sediment corrections or lateral density variations in crust/mantle.
*   **Key Insight:** Discrepancies between the gravity model and independent seismic data are valuable – they pinpoint areas where initial assumptions (like uniform density contrast or simple structure) might be insufficient and where complex geology likely exists.

**(Visuals: Show Fig 12a and 12b, potentially highlighting key areas of discrepancy on the maps/histogram)**
